/*
TO DO:
test this using the debugger.
Also get a test suite set up.

Split mapMajor and drawMajorByName into different files in src, maybe src/major.
export all using index.js
work on random draw. use a map split and reorganize to simulate card shuffling.

maybe a card shuffle animation?
maybe a card spread animation?
maybe a card display?
